Hurricane Statistics
Program Assignment #4
DESCRIPTION: The weather bureau keeps statistics on hurricanes for the past several years.

Develop a program that will read a sequence of records with the following fields:

Hurricane Name (Columns 1-10) Name of the hurricane

ID (Columns 12-14) Integer id of hurricane

Life (Columns 16-17) Life of hurricane in days

Date (Columns 19-22) Year of the hurricane

5 Wind recordings Real Measurement of wind speed

2 rain fall readings Real 2 measures of rain fall

Tornadoes spawned Integer Number of tornadoes created

I. First page

The program will print on the first page an echo of the Hurricane name, ID, Life, & Date as well as the average wind speed (determined by program) average rain fall (determined by program), and echo print the number of tornadoes spawned with appropriate headings and spacing, as well as the level of the hurricane or indication of tropical storm (determined by the program) and a summary line that indicates the total number of records (both true hurricanes and tropical storms). The total number of true hurricanes and the total number of tropical storms. True hurricanes and tropical storms are explained later.

II. Level Pages The next pages will contain a different page for each category of hurricanes (tropical storms are not listed) with:

1) The Level of the hurricane centered at the top.

2) The Name, ID, life, average wind speed, average rain fall, number of tornadoes and date of each storm, in alphabetical order by name.

3) A summary line for the number of Hurricanes for that particular level.

4) A summary line for the average life in days for the particular category, average rain, average number of tornadoes spawned and the average wind speed for that level.

The pages will be in level number order. Ex. Category 1 first.

III. Summary Page A summary page will consist of statistics from the hurricane records which will include

1) The average wind speed of all the hurricane averages

2) The Highest average wind speed

3) The Lowest average wind speed

4) The standard deviation of the wind speed

5) A listing of the number of hurricanes in each category

IV. Exception Reports Each storm is checked with an input file containing the id number of just tropical storms. Any storm found to be a hurricane by the program that appears in this file should generate an exception. (Should be listed in exception report 1).

Also any tropical storm found not to be on the input file of tropical storm should be listed on a separate exception report 2.

CLARIFICATION:

1) You must use the C++ user-defined structure data type and a function to sort the records.

2) You must use a function to check the ID of each hurricane (determined by the program) to see if it exists on the tropical storm input list. If it does than it's name must be printed on the exception report.

3) The first input file (infile1) will contain the list of tropical strom ID's that can be read into an array. You can assume that the records in the tropical strom ID file have been ordered (sorted in ascending order) but the actual ID's and the length of the file are variable.

4) The second input file (infile2) will contain an undetermined amount of records (sample data should contain at least 20) given the format above.

5) The sample data should have at least ten records that are not in the tropical storm list.

6) The program should allow for a maximum of 200 hurricanes, a maximum of 150 hurricanes in any one category.

7) All output is sent to output files and not the screen.

Finding the wind speeds: A hurricane wind speed is found by taking the average of the 5 input wind speeds.

The average wind speed of all hurricanes will be found by averaging the individual average wind speeds and then rounding to the nearest integer.

Level categories are assigned by using the rounded average wind speeds as follows:

Level Type Wind Speed Destruction

0 Tropical Storm not a hurricane Below 75

1 Weak 75-95 Minimal

2 Moderate 96-110 Moderate

3 Strong 111-130 Extensive

4 Very Strong 131-155 Extreme

5 Devastating > 155 Catastrophic

The standard deviation (sd) is a measure of "dispersion" in a collection of numbers. It is the square root of the variance. The variance is the average of the squared differences between each number and the mean of the collection of numbers. To find the standard deviation do the following:

1. Find the average (mean). avg

2. For each hurricanes average speed, find the difference between that speed and overall avg.

3. Square all of the differences found in step 2.

4. Find the average of the squares found in step 3. (This is the variance)

5. Take the square root of the variance and that is the standard deviation.

After finding the average (step 1 above), step 2 & 3 can be found as shown in the chart below:

Wind Speed Avg Speed-Avg (Speed-Avg)2

125 105 20 400

75 105 -30 900

140 105 35 1225

86 105 -19 361

90 105 -15 225

145 105 40 1600

105 105 0 0

74 105 -31 961

step 4: (400+900+1225+361+225+1600+0+961)/8 = 5672/8= 709

step 5: standard deviation is square root of 709 or 26.627
