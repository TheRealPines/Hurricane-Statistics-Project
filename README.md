# Hurricane Statistics Project

This all has to be done in C++.

I will have two files. One will contain IDs of storms that are classified as tropical storms and the other file will contain the information of all the storms. 

tropical.txt - contains the IDs for the tropical storms
storms.txt   - containst the informatino of all the storms
